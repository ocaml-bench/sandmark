(* We begin with a return to our arithmetic language from BasicSyntax,
 * adding subtraction*, which will come in handy later.
 * *: good pun, right? *)
Inductive arith : Set :=
| Const (n : nat)
| Var (x : var)
| Plus (e1 e2 : arith)
| Minus (e1 e2 : arith)
| Times (e1 e2 : arith).

Example ex1 := Const 42.
Example ex2 := Plus (Var "y") (Times (Var "x") (Const 3)).

(* The above definition only explains what programs *look like*.
 * We also care about what they *mean*.
 * The natural meaning of an expression is the number it evaluates to.
 * Actually, it's not quite that simple.
 * We need to consider the meaning to be a function over a valuation
 * to the variables, which in turn is itself a finite map from variable
 * names to numbers.  We use the book library's [fmap] type family. *)
Definition valuation := fmap var nat.
(* That is, the domain is [var] (a synonym for [string]) and the codomain/range
 * is [nat]. *)

(* The interpreter is a fairly innocuous-looking recursive function. *)
Fixpoint interp (e : arith) (v : valuation) : nat :=
  match e with
  | Const n => n
  | Var x =>
    (* Note use of infix operator to look up a key in a finite map. *)
    match v $? x with
    | None => 0 (* goofy default value! *)
    | Some n => n
    end
  | Plus e1 e2 => interp e1 v + interp e2 v
  | Minus e1 e2 => interp e1 v - interp e2 v
                   (* For anyone who's wondering: this [-] sticks at 0,
                    * if we would otherwise underflow. *)
  | Times e1 e2 => interp e1 v * interp e2 v
  end.

(* Here's an example valuation, using an infix operator for map extension. *)
Definition valuation0 : valuation :=
  $0 $+ ("x", 17) $+ ("y", 3).

(* Unfortunately, we can't execute code based on finite maps, since, for
 * convenience, they use uncomputable features.  The reason is that we need a
 * comparison function, a hash function, etc., to do computable finite-map
 * implementation, and such things are impossible to compute automatically for
 * all types in Coq.  However, we can still prove theorems about execution of
 * finite-map programs, and the [simplify] tactic knows how to reduce the
 * key constructions. *)
Theorem interp_ex1 : interp ex1 valuation0 = 42.
Proof.
  simplify.
  equality.
Qed.

Theorem interp_ex2 : interp ex2 valuation0 = 54.
Proof.
  unfold valuation0.

(* Here's the silly transformation we defined last time. *)
Fixpoint commuter (e : arith) : arith :=
  match e with
  | Const _ => e
  | Var _ => e
  | Plus e1 e2 => Plus (commuter e2) (commuter e1)
  | Minus e1 e2 => Minus (commuter e1) (commuter e2)
                   (* ^-- NB: didn't change the operand order here! *)
  | Times e1 e2 => Times (commuter e2) (commuter e1)
  end.

(* Instead of proving various odds-and-ends properties about it,
 * let's show what we *really* care about: it preserves the
 * *meanings* of expressions! *)
Theorem commuter_ok : forall v e, interp (commuter e) v = interp e v.

  induct e; simplify.

(* Well, that's a relief! ;-) *)

(* Let's also revisit substitution. *)
Fixpoint substitute (inThis : arith) (replaceThis : var) (withThis : arith) : arith :=
  match inThis with
  | Const _ => inThis
  | Var x => if x ==v replaceThis then withThis else inThis
  | Plus e1 e2 => Plus (substitute e1 replaceThis withThis) (substitute e2 replaceThis withThis)
  | Minus e1 e2 => Minus (substitute e1 replaceThis withThis) (substitute e2 replaceThis withThis)
  | Times e1 e2 => Times (substitute e1 replaceThis withThis) (substitute e2 replaceThis withThis)
  end.

Theorem substitute_ok : forall v replaceThis withThis inThis,
  interp (substitute inThis replaceThis withThis) v
  = interp inThis (v $+ (replaceThis, interp withThis v)).
Proof.
  induct inThis; simplify; try equality.

  (* One case left after our basic heuristic:
   * the variable case, naturally! *)
  cases (x ==v replaceThis); simplify; equality.
Qed.
(* Great; we seem to have gotten that one right, too. *)

(* Let's also define a pared-down version of the expression-simplification
 * functions from last chapter. *)
Fixpoint doSomeArithmetic (e : arith) : arith :=
  match e with
  | Const _ => e
  | Var _ => e
  | Plus (Const n1) (Const n2) => Const (n1 + n2)
  | Plus e1 e2 => Plus (doSomeArithmetic e1) (doSomeArithmetic e2)
  | Minus e1 e2 => Minus (doSomeArithmetic e1) (doSomeArithmetic e2)
  | Times (Const n1) (Const n2) => Const (n1 * n2)
  | Times e1 e2 => Times (doSomeArithmetic e1) (doSomeArithmetic e2)
  end.

(* Of course, we're going to get bored if we confine ourselves to arithmetic
 * expressions for the rest of our journey.  Let's get a bit fancier and define
 * a *stack machine*, related to postfix calculators that some of you may have
 * experienced. *)
Inductive instruction :=
| PushConst (n : nat)
| PushVar (x : var)
| Add
| Subtract
| Multiply.

(* What does it all mean?  An interpreter tells us unambiguously! *)
Definition run1 (i : instruction) (v : valuation) (stack : list nat) : list nat :=
  match i with
  | PushConst n => n :: stack
  | PushVar x => (match v $? x with
                  | None => 0
                  | Some n => n
                  end) :: stack
  | Add =>
    match stack with
    | arg2 :: arg1 :: stack' => arg1 + arg2 :: stack'
    | _ => stack (* arbitrary behavior in erroneous case (stack underflow) *)
    end
  | Subtract =>
    match stack with
    | arg2 :: arg1 :: stack' => arg1 - arg2 :: stack'
    | _ => stack (* arbitrary behavior in erroneous case *)
    end
  | Multiply =>
    match stack with
    | arg2 :: arg1 :: stack' => arg1 * arg2 :: stack'
    | _ => stack (* arbitrary behavior in erroneous case *)
    end
  end.

(* That function explained how to run one instruction.
 * Here's how to run several of them. *)
Fixpoint run (is : list instruction) (v : valuation) (stack : list nat) : list nat :=
  match is with
  | nil => stack
  | i :: is' => run is' v (run1 i v stack)
  end.

(* Instead of writing fiddly stack programs ourselves, let's *compile*
 * arithmetic expressions into equivalent stack programs. *)
Fixpoint compile (e : arith) : list instruction :=
  match e with
  | Const n => PushConst n :: nil
  | Var x => PushVar x :: nil
  | Plus e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ Add :: nil
  | Minus e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ Subtract :: nil
  | Times e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ Multiply :: nil
  end.

(* Now, of course, we should prove our compiler correct.
 * Skip down to the next theorem to see the overall correctness statement.
 * It turns out that we need to strengthen the induction hypothesis with a
 * lemma, to push the proof through. *)
Lemma compile_ok' : forall e v is stack,
    run (compile e ++ is) v stack = run is v (interp e v :: stack).
Proof.
  induct e; simplify.

  (* Here we want to use associativity of [++], to get the conclusion to match
   * an induction hypothesis.  Let's ask Coq to search its library for lemmas

(* The overall theorem follows as a simple corollary. *)
Theorem compile_ok : forall e v, run (compile e) v nil = interp e v :: nil.
Proof.

(* Let's get a bit fancier, moving toward the level of general-purpose
 * imperative languages.  Here's a language of commands, building on the
 * language of expressions we have defined. *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x : var) (e : arith)
| Sequence (c1 c2 : cmd)
| Repeat (e : arith) (body : cmd).

(* That last constructor is for repeating a body command some number of
 * times.  Note that we sneakily avoid constructs that could introduce
 * nontermination, since Coq only accepts terminating programs, and we want to
 * write an interpreter for commands.
 * In contrast to our last one, this interpreter *transforms valuations*.
 * We use a helper function for self-composing a function some number of
 * times. *)

Fixpoint selfCompose {A} (f : A -> A) (n : nat) : A -> A :=
  match n with
  | O => fun x => x
  | S n' => fun x => selfCompose f n' (f x)
  end.

Fixpoint exec (c : cmd) (v : valuation) : valuation :=
  match c with
  | Skip => v
  | Assign x e => v $+ (x, interp e v)
  | Sequence c1 c2 => exec c2 (exec c1 v)
  | Repeat e body => selfCompose (exec body) (interp e v) v
  end.

(* Let's define some programs and prove that they operate in certain ways. *)

Example factorial_ugly :=
  Sequence
    (Assign "output" (Const 1))
    (Repeat (Var "input")
            (Sequence
               (Assign "output" (Times (Var "output") (Var "input")))
               (Assign "input" (Minus (Var "input") (Const 1))))).

(* Ouch; that code is hard to read.  Let's introduce some notations to make the
 * concrete syntax more palatable.  We won't explain the general mechanisms on
 * display here, but see the Coq manual for details, or try to reverse-engineer
 * them from our examples. *)
Coercion Const : nat >-> arith.
Coercion Var : var >-> arith.
(*Declare Scope arith_scope.*)
Infix "+" := Plus : arith_scope.
Infix "-" := Minus : arith_scope.

Delimit Scope arith_scope with arith.

Infix ";" := Sequence (at level 76).
Notation "'repeat' e 'doing' body 'done'" := (Repeat e%arith body) (at level 75).

(* OK, let's try that program again. *)
Example factorial :=
  "output" <- 1;
  repeat "input" doing
    "output" <- "output" * "input";
    "input" <- "input" - 1

(* Now we prove that it really computes factorial.
 * First, a reference implementation as a functional program. *)
Fixpoint fact (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => 1
  | S n' => n * fact n'
  end.

(* To prove that [factorial] is correct, the real action is in a lemma, to be
 * proved by induction, showing that the loop works correctly.  So, let's first
 * assign a name to the loop body alone. *)
Definition factorial_body :=
  "output" <- "output" * "input";
  "input" <- "input" - 1.

(* Now for that lemma: self-composition of the body's semantics produces the
 * expected changes in the valuation.
 * Note that here we're careful to put the quantified variable [input] *first*,
 * because the variables coming after it will need to *change* in the course of
 * the induction.  Try switching the order to see what goes wrong if we put
 * [input] later. *)
