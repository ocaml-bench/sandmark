(** * Flow-insensitive analysis *)

(* So there's an example of an abstract interpretation, but how do we put it to
 * use to prove a theorem about a program?  Model checking was an example of a
 * *path-sensitive* analysis, where we accumulated a finite set of reachable
 * states of a system.  Abstract interpretation is usually *path-insensitive*,
 * and it may even be *flow-insensitive*, which means that we will find an
 * invariant that *ignores the current command altogether*.  Instead, the
 * invariant talks just about the valuation.  To help us do that, here's a type
 * definition: *)

Definition astate (a : absint) := fmap var a.

(* An abstract state maps variables to abstract elements.  The idea is that each
 * variable should take on a concrete value represented by its associated
 * abstract value.  These are only finite maps, so missing variables are allowed
 * to take arbitrary values. *)

(* An easy thing to do with an [astate] is evaluate an expression into another
 * abstract element. *)
Fixpoint absint_interp (e : arith) a (s : astate a) : a :=
  match e with
  | Const n => a.(Constant) n
  | Var x => match s $? x with
             | None => a.(Top)
             | Some xa => xa
             end
  | Plus e1 e2 => a.(Add) (absint_interp e1 s) (absint_interp e2 s)
  | Minus e1 e2 => a.(Subtract) (absint_interp e1 s) (absint_interp e2 s)
  | Times e1 e2 => a.(Multiply) (absint_interp e1 s) (absint_interp e2 s)
  end.

(* To automate finding a suitable path-insensitive invariant, it's helpful to
 * compute the set of all assignments in a command. *)
Fixpoint assignmentsOf (c : cmd) : set (var * arith) :=
  match c with
  | Skip => {}
  | Assign x e => {(x, e)}
  | Sequence c1 c2 => assignmentsOf c1 \cup assignmentsOf c2
  | If _ c1 c2 => assignmentsOf c1 \cup assignmentsOf c2
  | While _ c1 => assignmentsOf c1
  end.

(* Any step in a program can be matched by either doing nothing or running one
 * of the assignments. *)

(* OK, now we know all the assignments that could happen.  We can start with
 * some initial [astate] and repeatedly pick some assignment and execute it to
 * modify [astate].  The trouble would be if, for instance in our even-odd
 * example, the program had two assignments ["x" <- 0] and ["x" <- 1].  We could
 * alternate between these assignments and waste our time forever, switching
 * ["x"] back and forth between [Even] and [Odd]!  Instead, when we run an
 * assignment, we want to merge the new abstract value with the old, getting a
 * new value guaranteed to overapproximate both of them.  [merge_astate] applies
 * that combination to all variables in two abstract states, using a finite-map
 * function [merge] from the book library.  Any variable found in at most one of
 * the two input maps is absent from the output map, and any variable found in
 * both maps is now mapped to the *join* of the original values, using a crucial
 * component of any abstract interpretation. *)

(* With [merge_astate] in place, we can define a new transition system,
