(** * An object language with shared-memory concurrency *)

(* We're going to start investigating how to verify concurrent programs whose
 * behavior is given with operational semantics.  There are a variety of
 * different concurrency styles out there, with their distinctive practical and
 * theoretical benefits; we'll start with the most venerable style, shared
 * memory. *)

(* We'll build on the mixed-embedding languages from the last two chapter. 
 * Let's simplify the encoding by only working with commands that generate
 * [nat]. *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Return (r : nat)
| Bind (c1 : cmd) (c2 : nat -> cmd)
| Read (a : nat)
| Write (a v : nat)
| Fail

(* Now here's the new part: parallel composition of commands. *)
| Par (c1 c2 : cmd)

(* Let's also add locking commands, where locks are named by [nat]s. *)
| Lock (a : nat)
| Unlock (a : nat).

Notation "x <- c1 ; c2" := (Bind c1 (fun x => c2)) (right associativity, at level 80).
Infix "||" := Par.

(* As the program runs, it has not just a heap but also a set of locks that are
 * taken at that moment. *)
Definition locks := set nat.

(* The first few rules below are basically the same as in last chapter, except
 * that we relax the restriction on only reading/writing addresses that are
 * explicitly mapped into the heap. *)
Inductive step : heap * locks * cmd -> heap * locks * cmd -> Prop :=
| StepBindRecur : forall c1 c1' c2 h h' l l',
  step (h, l, c1) (h', l', c1')
  -> step (h, l, Bind c1 c2) (h', l', Bind c1' c2)
| StepBindProceed : forall v c2 h l,
  step (h, l, Bind (Return v) c2) (h, l, c2 v)

| StepRead : forall h l a,
  step (h, l, Read a) (h, l, Return (h $! a))
| StepWrite : forall h l a v,
  step (h, l, Write a v) (h $+ (a, v), l, Return 0)

(* First interesting twist: we can "push steps through" the [Par] operator on
 * either side.  The choice of a side is the sole source of nondeterminism in
 * this semantics, corresponding to the whims of a scheduler. *)
| StepParRecur1 : forall h l c1 c2 h' l' c1',
  step (h, l, c1) (h', l', c1')
  -> step (h, l, Par c1 c2) (h', l', Par c1' c2)
| StepParRecur2 : forall h l c1 c2 h' l' c2',
  step (h, l, c2) (h', l', c2')
  -> step (h, l, Par c1 c2) (h', l', Par c1 c2')

(* To take a lock, it must not be held; and vice versa for releasing a lock. *)
| StepLock : forall h l a,
  ~a \in l
  -> step (h, l, Lock a) (h, {a} \cup l, Return 0)
| StepUnlock : forall h l a,

(** * An example *)

(* In this lecture, we'll focus on model checking as our program-proof
 * technique.  Recall that model checking is all about reducing a problem to a
 * reachability question in a finite-state system.  Our programs here have the
 * (perhaps surprising!) property that termination is guaranteed, for any
 * initial state, regardless of how the scheduler behaves.  Therefore, all
 * programs of this language are finite-state and thus, in principle, amenable
 * to model checking!  (We were careful to leave out looping constructs.)
 * Let's define a simple two-thread program and model-check it. *)

(* Throughout this file, we'll only be verifying that no thread could ever reach
 * a [Fail] command that is next in line to execute, a property that is easy to
 * phrase as an invariant of the transition system.  Here's how to compute
 * whether a command is about to fail. *)
Fixpoint notAboutToFail (c : cmd) : bool :=
  match c with
  | Fail => false
  | Bind c1 _ => notAboutToFail c1
  | Par c1 c2 => notAboutToFail c1 && notAboutToFail c2
  | _ => true
  end.

Example two_increments_thread :=
  _ <- Lock 0;
  n <- Read 0;
  if n <=? 1 then
    _ <- Write 0 (n + 1);
    Unlock 0
  else
    Fail.

Example two_increments := two_increments_thread || two_increments_thread.

(* Next, we do one of our standard boring (and slow; sorry!) model-checking
 * proofs, where tactics explore the finite state space for us. *)

(* Notice how every step of the process needs to consider all possibilities of
 * threads that could run next, which, in general, gives us state spaces of size
 * *exponential* in the program-text length.  That's really a shame from a
 * performance perspective, isn't it?  Our goal now will be to apply
 * *optimizations* that show equivalence with alternative transition systems
 * whose state spaces are smaller.  By the end, we'll be able to check
 * nontrivial concurrent programs by only computing state spaces with *linear*
 * size in program-text length!  (The catch is that the technique only applies
 * for programs accepted by a simple static analysis.) *)

  | Par c1 c2 => Par (runLocal c1) (runLocal c2)
  | Lock _ => c

(* We can define an alternative step relation that always runs [runLocal] as a

 * need to run separate exploration steps for all of those trivial

(** * Optimization #2: partial-order reduction *)

(* There was a key property lurking behind the soundness proof of our last
 * optimization: *commutativity*, one of the most common ways to tame the
 * state-space explosion from concurrency scheduling.  Specifically, the local
 * steps performed by [runLocal] all *commute* with any steps taken in other
 * threads, because they are agnostic to shared state.  Can we generalize the
 * technique to also harness commutativity of operations that *do* depend on the
 * shared state, but in particular controlled ways?  Why, yes we can!  The most
 * popular such technique from the model-checking world is
 * *partial-order reduction*. *)

(* First, here's an example where we should be able to do better than allowing
 * either thread to run in every step, as we model-check. *)
Example independent_threads :=
  (a <- Read 0;
   _ <- Write 1 (a + 1);
   a <- Read 1;
   if a ==n 1 then
     Return 0
   else
     Fail)
  || (b <- Read 2;
      Write 2 (b + 1)).

(* It turns out that we can actually do model-checking where at each point we
 * only explore the result of running *the first thread that is ready*!  Such a
 * strategy isn't sound for all programs, but it is for our example here.  Why?
 * Every pair of atomic actions between threads *commutes*.  That is, neither
 * one affects whether the other is enabled to execute (the way that one [Lock]
 * can disable another), and running the two actions in either order modifies
 * shared state identically.  In such a case, we may always pick our favorite
 * thread to step next. *)
