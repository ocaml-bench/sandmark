(** * Ltac Programming Basics *)

(* We have already seen a few examples of Ltac programs, without much explanation.
 * Ltac is the proof scripting language built into Coq.  Actually, every
 * primitive step in our proofs has been a (degenerate, small) Ltac program.
 * Let's take a bottom-up look at more Ltac features.
 *
 * We've seen [match goal] tactics a few times so far.  They allow syntactic
 * inspection of hypothesis and conclusion formulas of current goals, where we
 * pick tactics to run based on what we find.  Here's a simple example to
 * find an [if] and do a case split based on its test expression. *)

Ltac find_if :=
  match goal with
    | [ |- if ?X then _ else _ ] => cases X
  end.

(* Here's a proof that becomes trivial, given [find_if].  You can imagine a
 * whole family of similar theorems that also become trivial. *)

Theorem hmm : forall (a b c : bool),
  if a
    then if b
      then True
      else True
    else if c
      then True
      else True.
Proof.
  simplify.
  repeat find_if. (* Note [repeat] for "run over and over until you can't
                   * progress." *)
  trivial. (* A fun tactic that consults a database of really boring steps. *)
  trivial.
  trivial.
  trivial.

  (* Let's write that again with more automation. *)
  Restart.
  simplify; repeat find_if; trivial.
Qed.

(* Another very useful Ltac building block is *context patterns*. *)

Ltac find_if_inside :=
  match goal with
    | [ |- context[if ?X then _ else _] ] => cases X
  end.

(* The behavior of this tactic is to find any subterm of the conclusion that is
 * an [if] and then [cases] the test expression.  This version subsumes
 * [find_if].  The general behavior of [context] (an Ltac keyword) is to allow
 * matching in arbitrary subterms. *)

Theorem hmm' : forall (a b c : bool),
  if a
    then if b
      then True
      else True
    else if c
      then True
      else True.
Proof.
  simplify; repeat find_if_inside; trivial.
Qed.

(* We can also use [find_if_inside] to prove goals that [find_if] does not
 * simplify sufficiently. *)

Theorem hmm2 : forall (a b : bool),
  (if a then 42 else 42) = (if b then 42 else 42).
Proof.
  simplify; repeat find_if_inside; equality.
Qed.

(* [match goal] has useful backtracking semantics.  When one rule fails, we

(* The example shows how failure can move to a different pattern within a

Proof.

  (* Coq prints "[H1]".  By applying [idtac] with an argument, a convenient
   * debugging tool for "leaking information out of [match]es," we see that
   * this [match] first tries binding [H] to [H1], which cannot be used to prove
   * [Q].  Nonetheless, the following variation on the tactic succeeds at

(* The tactic first unifies [H] with [H1], as before, but [exact H] fails in
 * that case, so the tactic engine searches for more possible values of [H].
 * Eventually, it arrives at the correct value, so that [exact H] and the
 * overall tactic succeed. *)

(* Let's try some more ambitious reasoning, with quantifiers.  We'll be
 * instantiating quantified facts heuristically.  If we're not careful, we get
 * in a loop repeating the same instantiation forever.  We'll need a way to
 * check that a fact is not already known.  Here's a tactic: *)

           * declare success. *)
      end
  end.

(* The number for [fail N] indicates failing at the backtracking point [N]
 * levels out from where we are.  [first] applies the first tactic that does not
 * fail. *)

(* This tactic adds a fact to the context, only if it is not not already
 * present. *)
