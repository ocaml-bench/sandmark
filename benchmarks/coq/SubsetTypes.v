(* So far, we have seen many examples of what we might call "classical program
 * verification."  We write programs, write their specifications, and then prove
 * that the programs satisfy their specifications.  The programs that we have
 * written in Coq have been normal functional programs that we could just as
 * well have written in Haskell or ML.  In this lecture, we start investigating
 * uses of _dependent types_ to integrate programming, specification, and
 * proving into a single phase.  The techniques we will learn make it possible
 * to reduce the cost of program verification dramatically. *)


(** * Introducing Subset Types *)

(** Let us consider several ways of implementing the natural-number-predecessor
 * function.  We start by displaying the definition from the standard library: *)

Compute pred.

(* We can use a new command, [Extraction], to produce an OCaml version of this
 * function. *)

Extraction pred.

(* Returning 0 as the predecessor of 0 can come across as somewhat of a hack.
 * In some situations, we might like to be sure that we never try to take the
 * predecessor of 0.  We can enforce this by giving [pred] a stronger, dependent
 * type. *)

Lemma zgtz : 0 > 0 -> False.
Proof.
  linear_arithmetic.
Qed.

Definition pred_strong1 (n : nat) : n > 0 -> nat :=
  match n with
    | O => fun pf : 0 > 0 => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => fun _ => n'
  end.

(* We expand the type of [pred] to include a _proof_ that its argument [n] is
 * greater than 0.  When [n] is 0, we use the proof to derive a contradiction,
 * which we can use to build a value of any type via a vacuous pattern match.
 * When [n] is a successor, we have no need for the proof and just return the
 * answer.  The proof argument can be said to have a _dependent_ type, because
 * its type depends on the _value_ of the argument [n].
 *
 * Coq's [Compute] command can execute particular invocations of [pred_strong1]
 * just as easily as it can execute more traditional functional programs. *)

Theorem two_gt0 : 2 > 0.
Proof.
  linear_arithmetic.
Qed.

Compute pred_strong1 two_gt0.

(* One aspect in particular of the definition of [pred_strong1] may be
 * surprising.  We took advantage of [Definition]'s syntactic sugar for defining
 * function arguments in the case of [n], but we bound the proofs later with
 * explicit [fun] expressions.  Let us see what happens if we write this
 * function in the way that at first seems most natural. *)

Fail Definition pred_strong1' (n : nat) (pf : n > 0) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => n'
  end.

(* The term [zgtz pf] fails to type-check.  Somehow the type checker has failed
 * to take into account information that follows from which [match] branch that
 * term appears in.  The problem is that, by default, [match] does not let us
 * use such implied information.  To get refined typing, we must always rely on
 * [match] annotations, either written explicitly or inferred.
 *
 * In this case, we must use a [return] annotation to declare the relationship
 * between the _value_ of the [match] discriminee and the _type_ of the result.
 * There is no annotation that lets us declare a relationship between the
 * discriminee and the type of a variable that is already in scope; hence, we
 * delay the binding of [pf], so that we can use the [return] annotation to
 * express the needed relationship.
 *
 * We are lucky that Coq's heuristics infer the [return] clause (specifically,
 * [return n > 0 -> nat]) for us in the definition of [pred_strong1], leading to
 * the following elaborated code: *)

Definition pred_strong1' (n : nat) : n > 0 -> nat :=
  match n return n > 0 -> nat with
    | O => fun pf : 0 > 0 => match zgtz pf with end
    | S n' => fun _ => n'
  end.

(* By making explicit the functional relationship between value [n] and the
 * result type of the [match], we guide Coq toward proper type checking.  The
 * clause for this example follows by simple copying of the original annotation
 * on the definition.  In general, however, the [match] annotation inference
 * problem is undecidable.  The known undecidable problem of
 * _higher-order unification_ reduces to the [match] type inference problem.
 * Over time, Coq is enhanced with more and more heuristics to get around this
 * problem, but there must always exist [match]es whose types Coq cannot infer
 * without annotations.
 *
 * Let us now take a look at the OCaml code Coq generates for [pred_strong1]. *)

Extraction pred_strong1.

(* The proof argument has disappeared!  We get exactly the OCaml code we would
 * have written manually.  This is our first demonstration of the main
 * technically interesting feature of Coq program extraction: proofs are erased
 * systematically.
 *
 * We can reimplement our dependently typed [pred] based on _subset types_,
 * defined in the standard library with the type family [sig]. *)

Print sig.

(* We rewrite [pred_strong1], using some syntactic sugar for subset types, after
 * we deactivate some clashing notations for set literals. *)

Locate "{ _ : _ | _ }".

Definition pred_strong2 (s : {n : nat | n > 0} ) : nat :=
  match s with
    | exist O pf => match zgtz pf with end
    | exist (S n') _ => n'
  end.

(* To build a value of a subset type, we use the [exist] constructor, and the
 * details of how to do that follow from the output of our earlier [Print sig]
 * command, where we elided the extra information that parameter [A] is
 * implicit.  We need an extra [_] here and not in the definition of
 * [pred_strong2] because _parameters_ of inductive types (like the predicate
 * [P] for [sig]) are not mentioned in pattern matching, but _are_ mentioned in
 * construction of terms (if they are not marked as implicit arguments).
 * (Actually, this behavior changed between Coq versions 8.4 and 8.5, hence the
 * command at the top of the file to revert to the old behavior.) *)

Compute pred_strong2 (exist _ 2 two_gt0).

Extraction pred_strong2.

(* We arrive at the same OCaml code as was extracted from [pred_strong1], which
 * may seem surprising at first.  The reason is that a value of [sig] is a pair
 * of two pieces, a value and a proof about it.  Extraction erases the proof,
 * which reduces the constructor [exist] of [sig] to taking just a single
 * argument.  An optimization eliminates uses of datatypes with single
 * constructors taking single arguments, and we arrive back where we started.
 *
 * We can continue on in the process of refining [pred]'s type.  Let us change
 * its result type to capture that the output is really the predecessor of the
 * input. *)

Definition pred_strong3 (s : {n : nat | n > 0}) : {m : nat | proj1_sig s = S m} :=
  match s return {m : nat | proj1_sig s = S m} with
    | exist 0 pf => match zgtz pf with end
    | exist (S n') pf => exist _ n' (eq_refl _)
  end.

Compute pred_strong3 (exist _ 2 two_gt0).

(* A value in a subset type can be thought of as a _dependent pair_ (or
 * _sigma type_) of a base value and a proof about it.  The function [proj1_sig]
 * extracts the first component of the pair.  It turns out that we need to
 * include an explicit [return] clause here, since Coq's heuristics are not
 * smart enough to propagate the result type that we wrote earlier.
 *
 * By now, the reader is probably ready to believe that the new [pred_strong]
 * leads to the same OCaml code as we have seen several times so far, and Coq
 * does not disappoint. *)

Extraction pred_strong3.

(* We have managed to reach a type that is, in a formal sense, the most
 * expressive possible for [pred].  Any other implementation of the same type
 * must have the same input-output behavior.  However, there is still room for
 * improvement in making this kind of code easier to write.  Here is a version
 * that takes advantage of tactic-based theorem proving.  We switch back to
 * passing a separate proof argument instead of using a subset type for the
 * function's input, because this leads to cleaner code.  ([False_rec] is a
 * library function that can be used to produce a value in any type given a
 * proof of [False].  It's defined in terms of the vacuous pattern match we saw
 * earlier.) *)

Definition pred_strong4 : forall (n : nat), n > 0 -> {m : nat | n = S m}.
  refine (fun n =>
    match n with
      | O => fun _ => False_rec _ _
      | S n' => fun _ => exist _ n' _
    end).

  (* We build [pred_strong4] using tactic-based proving, beginning with a
   * [Definition] command that ends in a period before a definition is given.
   * Such a command enters the interactive proving mode, with the type given for
   * the new identifier as our proof goal.
   *
   * We do most of the work with the [refine] tactic, to which we pass a partial
   * "proof" of the type we are trying to prove.  There may be some pieces left
   * to fill in, indicated by underscores.  Any underscore that Coq cannot
   * reconstruct with type inference is added as a proof subgoal.  In this case,
   * we have two subgoals.
   *
   * We can see that the first subgoal comes from the second underscore passed
   * to [False_rec], and the second subgoal comes from the second underscore
   * passed to [exist].  In the first case, we see that, though we bound the
   * proof variable with an underscore, it is still available in our proof
   * context.  It is hard to refer to underscore-named variables in manual
   * proofs, but automation makes short work of them.  Both subgoals are easy to
   * discharge that way, so let us back up and ask to prove all subgoals
   * automatically. *)

Print sumbool.

(* Here, the constructors of [sumbool] have types written in terms of a

(* The [Reduce] notation is notable because it demonstrates how [if] is

 * branches, the appropriate constructor arguments are bound.  This is important
 * when working with [sumbool]s, when we want to have the proof stored in the
 * test expression available when proving the proof obligations generated in the
 * appropriate branch.
 *
 * Now we can write [eq_nat_dec], which compares two natural numbers, returning
 * either a proof of their equality or a proof of their inequality. *)

(* Curious readers can verify that the [decide equality] version extracts to the

(** * Partial Subset Types *)

(* Our final implementation of dependent predecessor used a very specific
 * argument type to ensure that execution could always complete normally.
 * Sometimes we want to allow execution to fail, and we want a more principled
 * way of signaling failure than returning a default value, as [pred] does for
 * [0].  One approach is to define this type family [maybe], which is a version
 * of [sig] that allows obligation-free failure. *)

Inductive maybe (A : Set) (P : A -> Prop) : Set :=
| Unknown : maybe P
| Found : forall x : A, P x -> maybe P.

(* We can define some new notations, analogous to those we defined for subset

(* Because we used [maybe], one valid implementation of the type we gave

Notation "[|| x ||]" := (inleft _ [x]).

(** * Monadic Notations *)

(* We can treat [maybe] like a monad, in the same way that the Haskell [Maybe]
 * type is interpreted as a failure monad.  Our [maybe] has the wrong type to be
 * a literal monad, but a "bind"-like notation will still be helpful. *)

(* The meaning of [x <- e1; e2] is: First run [e1].  If it fails to find an
 * answer, then announce failure for our derived computation, too.  If [e1]
 * _does_ find an answer, pass that answer on to [e2] to find the final result.
 * The variable [x] can be considered bound in [e2].
 *
 * This notation is very helpful for composing richly typed procedures.  For
 * instance, here is a very simple implementation of a function to take the
 * predecessors of two naturals at once. *)
