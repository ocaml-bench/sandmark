(* Here's a classic recursive, functional program for factorial. *)
Fixpoint fact (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => 1
  | S n' => fact n' * S n'
  end.

(* But let's reformulate factorial relationally, as an example to explore
 * treatment of inductive relations in Coq.  First, these are the states of our
 * state machine. *)
Inductive fact_state :=
| AnswerIs (answer : nat)
| WithAccumulator (input accumulator : nat).

(* This *predicate* captures which states are starting states.
 * Before the main colon of [Inductive], we list *parameters*, which stay fixed
 * throughout recursive invocations of a predicate (though this definition does
 * not use recursion).  After the colon, we give a type that expresses which
 * additional arguments exist, followed by [Prop] for "proposition."
 * Putting this inductive definition in [Prop] is what marks it as a predicate.
 * Our prior definitions have implicitly been in [Set], the normal universe
 * of mathematical objects. *)
Inductive fact_init (original_input : nat) : fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactInit : fact_init original_input (WithAccumulator original_input 1).

(** And here are the states where we declare execution complete. *)
Inductive fact_final : fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactFinal : forall ans, fact_final (AnswerIs ans).

(** The most important part: the relation to step between states *)
Inductive fact_step : fact_state -> fact_state -> Prop :=
| FactDone : forall acc,
  fact_step (WithAccumulator O acc) (AnswerIs acc)
| FactStep : forall n acc,
  fact_step (WithAccumulator (S n) acc) (WithAccumulator n (acc * S n)).

(* We care about more than just single steps.  We want to run factorial to
 * completion, for which it is handy to define a general relation of
 * *transitive-reflexive closure*, like so. *)
Inductive trc {A} (R : A -> A -> Prop) : A -> A -> Prop :=
| TrcRefl : forall x, trc R x x
| TrcFront : forall x y z,
  R x y
  -> trc R y z
  -> trc R x z.

(* Ironically, this definition is not obviously transitive!
 * Let's prove transitivity as a lemma. *)
Theorem trc_trans : forall {A} (R : A -> A -> Prop) x y, trc R x y
  -> forall z, trc R y z
    -> trc R x z.
Proof.
  induct 1; simplify.

   * *the first hypothesis in the theorem statement*. *)

  (* [assumption]: prove a conclusion that matches some hypothesis exactly. *)

  (* [eapply H]: like [apply], but works when it is not obvious how to
   *   instantiate the quantifiers of theorem/hypothesis [H].  Instead,
   *   placeholders are inserted for those quantifiers, to be determined
   *   later. *)
  eassumption.
  (* [eassumption]: prove a conclusion that matches some hypothesis, when we
   *   choose the right clever instantiation of placeholders.  Those placehoders
   *   are then replaced everywhere with their new values. *)

Notation "R ^*" := (trc R) (at level 0).

(* Now let's use it to execute the factorial program. *)

(* That was exhausting yet uninformative.  We can use a different tactic to blow

Example factorial_3_auto : fact_step^* (WithAccumulator 3 1) (AnswerIs 6).
Proof.
  repeat econstructor.
  (* [econstructor]: tries all declared rules of the predicate in the
   *   conclusion, attempting each with [eapply] until one works. *)

  (* Note that here [econstructor] is doing double duty, applying the rules of
   * both [trc] and [fact_step]. *)
Qed.

(* It will be useful to give state machines more first-class status, as
 * *transition systems*, formalized by this record type.  It has one type
 * parameter, [state], which records the type of states. *)
Record trsys state := {
  Initial : state -> Prop;
  Step : state -> state -> Prop
}.
(* Probably it's intuitively clear what a record type must be.
 * See usage examples below to fill in more of the details.
 * Note that [state] is a polymorphic type parameter. *)

(* The example of our factorial program: *)
Definition factorial_sys (original_input : nat) : trsys fact_state := {|
  Initial := fact_init original_input;
  Step := fact_step
|}.

(* A useful general notion for transition systems: reachable states *)
Inductive reachable {state} (sys : trsys state) (st : state) : Prop :=
| Reachable : forall st0,
  sys.(Initial) st0
  -> sys.(Step)^* st0 st
  -> reachable sys st.

(* To prove that our state machine is correct, we rely on the crucial technique
 * of *invariants*.  What is an invariant?  Here's a general definition, in
 * terms of an arbitrary transition system. *)
Definition invariantFor {state} (sys : trsys state) (invariant : state -> Prop) :=

            -> forall s', sys.(Step)^* s s'

(* That is, when we begin in an initial state and take any number of steps, the
