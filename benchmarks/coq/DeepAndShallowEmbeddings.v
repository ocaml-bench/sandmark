(** * Basic concepts of shallow, deep, and mixed embeddings *)

(* We often have many options for how to encode some sort of formal expression.
 * The simplest way is to write it directly as a Gallina functional program,
 * which Coq knows how to evaluate directly.  That style is called
 * *shallow embedding*. *)

Module SimpleShallow.
  Definition foo (x y : nat) : nat :=
    let u := x + y in
    let v := u * y in
    u + v.
End SimpleShallow.

(* Alternatively, we can do as we have been through most of the chapters: define
 * inductive types of program syntax, along with semantics for syntax trees.
 * That style is called *deep embedding*. *)

Module SimpleDeep.
  Inductive exp :=
  | Const (n : nat)
  | Var (x : var)
  | Plus (e1 e2 : exp)
  | Times (e1 e2 : exp)
  | Let (x : var) (e1 e2 : exp).

  Definition foo : exp :=
    Let "u" (Plus (Var "x") (Var "y"))
        (Let "v" (Times (Var "u") (Var "y"))
             (Plus (Var "u") (Var "v"))).

  Fixpoint interp (e : exp) (v : fmap var nat) : nat :=
    match e with
    | Const n => n
    | Var x => v $! x
    | Plus e1 e2 => interp e1 v + interp e2 v
    | Times e1 e2 => interp e1 v * interp e2 v
    | Let x e1 e2 => interp e2 (v $+ (x, interp e1 v))
    end.
End SimpleDeep.

(* We defined function [foo] in shallow and deep styles, and it is easy to prove
 * that the encodings are equivalent. *)
Theorem shallow_to_deep : forall x y,
    SimpleShallow.foo x y = SimpleDeep.interp SimpleDeep.foo ($0 $+ ("x", x) $+ ("y", y)).
Proof.

(* More interestingly, we can mix characteristics of the two styles.  To explain
 * exactly how, it's important to introduce the distinction between the
 * *metalanguage*, in which we do our proofs (e.g., Coq for us); and the
 * *object language*, which we formalize explicitly (e.g., lambda calculus,
 * simple imperative programs, ...).  With *higher-order abstract syntax*, we
 * represent binders of the object language using the function types of the
 * metalanguage. *)
Module SimpleMixed.

  | Const (n : nat)
  | Var (x : string)
  | Plus (e1 e2 : exp)
  | Times (e1 e2 : exp)
  | Let (e1 : exp) (e2 : nat -> exp).
  (* Note a [Let] body is a *function* over the computed value attached to the
   * variable being bound. *)

    | Times e1 e2 => interp e1 v * interp e2 v
    | Let e1 e2 => interp (e2 (interp e1 v)) v
    end.

   * as in this function to recursively simplify additions of 0 and
   * multiplications by 1. *)

      | _ => Let e1' (fun n => reduce (e2 n))
      end

(** * A basic deep embedding *)

(* One disadvantage of the last style of programs is computational efficiency:
 * real CPU architectures don't manipulate memory as functional maps that are
 * passed around, and the abstraction gap between our code and CPUs prevents us
 * from taking maximum advantage of the hardware to achieve good performance.
 * To help regain that efficiency, let's do a deep embedding of the language.
 * Actually, it's a mixed embedding, with no explicit concept of variables,
 * using higher-order abstract syntax to represent binders. *)
