(* The last few chapters have focused on small programming languages that are
 * representative of the essence of the imperative languages.  We now turn to
 * lambda-calculus, the usual representative of functional languages. *)

   * executing for side effects. *)

    (* A function that binds its argument to the given variable, evaluating the
     * body expression *)
  | App (e1 e2 : exp).
    (* Applying a function to an argument *)

  (* Key operation: within [e], changing every occurrence of variable [x] into
   * [rep].  IMPORTANT: we will only apply this operation in contexts where
   * [rep] is *closed*, meaning every [Var] refers to some enclosing [Abs], so
   * as to avoid *variable capture*.  See the book proper for a little more
   * discussion. *)

  (** * Big-step semantics *)

  (* This is the most straightforward way to give semantics to lambda terms:
   * We evaluate any closed term into a value (that is, an [Abs]). *)
  Inductive eval : exp -> exp -> Prop :=

    -> eval e2 v2
    -> eval (subst v2 x e1') v
    -> eval (App e1 e2) v.

  (* Note that we omit a [Var] case, since variable terms can't be *closed*,
   * and therefore they aren't meaningful as top-level programs. *)

  (* Which terms are values, that is, final results of execution? *)
  Inductive value : exp -> Prop :=
  | Value : forall x e, value (Abs x e).
  (* We're cheating a bit here, *assuming* that the term is also closed. *)

  (** * Church Numerals, everyone's favorite example of lambda terms in

  (* Here are two curious definitions. *)
  Definition zero := \"f", \"x", "x".
  Definition plus1 := \"n", \"f", \"x", "f" @ ("n" @ "f" @ "x").

  (* We can build up any natural number [n] as [plus1^n @ zero].  Let's prove
   * that, in fact, these definitions constitute a workable embedding of the
   * natural numbers in lambda-calculus. *)

  (* A term [plus^n @ zero] evaluates to something very close to what this
   * function returns. *)

    | S n' => "f" @ ((\"f", \"x", canonical' n') @ "f" @ "x")

  (* This missing piece is this wrapper. *)
  Definition canonical n := \"f", \"x", canonical' n.

  (* Let's formalize our definition of what it means to represent a number. *)
  Definition represents (e : exp) (n : nat) :=

  (* What's basically going on here?  The representation of number [n] is [N]

   *   N(f) = f^n
   * That is, we represent a number as its repeated-composition operator.
   * So, given a number, we can use it to repeat any operation.  In particular,
   * to implement addition, we can just repeat [plus1]! *)
  Definition add := \"n", \"m", "n" @ plus1 @ "m".

  (* Our addition works properly on this test case. *)
  Example add_1_2 : exists v,
