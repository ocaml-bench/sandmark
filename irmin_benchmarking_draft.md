##Benchmarking Irmin

####Rough Draft on how to go about

* Merging 2 text files
  * Start with 2 considerably large files and try to merge them.
  * Build a random text generator.
  * The degree of how different the documents are, variations in the differences between the files can be accounted to test the merging capabilities.


* Benchmarking the merge function
  * To benchmark the function go through the [blogpost](https://github.com/prismlab/docs/wiki/Adding-a-benchmark-to-Sandmark) created in the prismlab github repo.
